Business Understanding

In recent times, the number of fraud transactions has increased drastically, due to which credit card companies are facing a lot of challenges. For many banks, retaining high profitable customers is the most important business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal. In terms of substantial financial loss, trust and credibility, banking fraud is a concerning issue for both banks and customers alike. With the rise in digital payment channels, the number of fraudulent transactions is also increasing as fraudsters are finding new and different ways to commit such crimes.
Now, letâ€™s watch the upcoming video as Thejasvee sheds light on fraud analytics, some common types of fraud happening across different industries and the different ways in which you can deal with it using machine learning.

Problem Statement

In the banking industry, detecting credit card fraud using machine learning is not just a trend; it is a necessity for banks, as they need to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning helps these institutions reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denial of legitimate transactions.
Suppose you are part of the analytics team working on a fraud detection model and its cost-benefit analysis. You need to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions based on the historical transactional data of customers with a pool of merchants. Based on your understanding of the model, you have to analyse the business impact of these fraudulent transactions and recommend the optimal ways that the bank can adopt to mitigate the fraud risks.
